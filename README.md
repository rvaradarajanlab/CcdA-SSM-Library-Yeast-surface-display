# CcdA-SSM-Library-Yeast-surface-display
Data relevant to Deep mutational scanning study of CcdA using yeast surface display
Data Related to Manuscript titled "Inferring bound structure and residue specific contributions to binding energetics in the Intrinsically Disordered Protein, CcdA".

Excel file titled “freq_NNK" includes the read numbers for each mutant in different deep sequencing experimental samples (named in terms of MIDs) obtained after processing of the raw deep sequencing data.

Excel file titled “subset2libNNM" includes the read numbers for each mutant with NNM codon.

Excel file titled “WT read counts" includes the read numbers for WT CcdA across different gates in the two biological replicates.
Excel file titled “Analyzed NGS Data Results” includes the mutational tolerance scores MTSseq for each single-site mutant of CcdA, calculated using the deep sequencing data.

Excel file titled “YSD titration” includes the raw data used for calculation of dissociation constants and free energy of binding. The file lists the mean fluorescence intensity values for CcdB binding monitored for CcdA WT and a number of single mutants titrated against a range of CcdB concentrations. 
Excel file titled “parameters” includes the MID information and sorting parameters. This file also consists of the comparison among different substitution patterns; and category penalties calculated from CcdA deep mutational data and used in IPApred.
